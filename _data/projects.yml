   Used STATA from regression analysis of the portfolio established by Markowitz theory, based on the Fama French
   three-factor model and Fama French three-factor model, to calculate excess returns of recommended stocks. Concluded that 
   the strategy that constructed a portfolio with Bloomberg's algorithm could achieve greater returns for investors.

#   name: 'Underwater spectrophotometer for in-situ seawater COD monitoring'
#   description: >
#     We designed an in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor for long-term seawater 
#     monitoring, and interrated it to a buoy for coastal trials. It makes COD monitoring 
#     becomes possible and simple. The sensors had been contiously working underwater for 
#     more than 6 months and provides thousands of valuable UV-Vis absorption spectrum.

#   description: >
#    Cross-Video Neural Representation (CURE) is a Deep-learning-based model for temporal 
#    video interpolation, where the goal is to synthesize a new video frame given its two 
#    neighbors. It is the first video interpolation method based on neural fields (NF) 
#    and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video 
#    interpolation on several benchmark datasets.

#   name: 'Wireless Auto-Detection Electromagnetic Gun'
#   description: >
#    In this small project, I designed and made a wireless electromagnetic gun. 
#    Both radio and gun are built with STM32F103. The radio could show the current voltage, 
#    firing status, and could auto detect object near it. When the object approaching, 
#    it will send fire signal to the electromagnetic gun through 2.4G NFR24L01. The controller 
#    has two buttons that user could use for manually firing. The electromagnetic gun is 
#    powered by two XL6009 that transfer 12V DC to ~70V DC. Two capacitances are used 
#    to store the power. The steel ball could be ejected for ~30 feets.

#   name: 'Three Phase DC-AC Converter'
#   description: >
#    This three phase DC-AC converter aims for converting 12V DC power to 
#    three phase 24V AC power. This system is controlled by a STM32F103 Microcontrol Unit, 
#    which provides features like voltage regulation, phase regulation, over-current protection.
#    The efficiency is higher than 90%. Phase regulation enables two converter grid-connected. 
#    The output voltage is regulated with PID algorithm for 100 times per second.
