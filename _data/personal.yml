intro:
  title: About me
  body: >
    I come from a background in economics, holding a Master's degree from the University of Southern California
    (USC). Currently, I work as a Data Operations Associate at PitchBook. My career journey has been shaped by a passion for data analysis and coding-related projects.
    <br><br>
    I have had the privilege of gaining valuable experience through internships at renowned companies such as Deloitte and China 
    Merchants Securities Co., Ltd. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in data analysis and research.
    <br><br>
    I find great joy in learning and working on data-related tasks. Recently, I've been actively expanding my knowledge by studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript online. 
    I have been in communication with members of the R-Tool team, sharing my ideas and interests, and even shadowing some of their specific work tasks. 
    What sets me apart is my commitment to ongoing learning and growth. Even after joining the team, I am dedicated to continuously expanding my knowledge and skills. 
    I believe in staying current with the latest developments in data analysis and coding to bring new perspectives and innovative solutions to the team.
    <br><br>
    I'm particularly enthusiastic about contributing to the team by enhancing the functionality of R-Tool to improve research efficiency. 
    I believe that my background and dedication can make a meaningful contribution to the team's success.
