  title: About me
  body: >
    I am a research assistant in ECE at Washington University in St. Louis with 
    [Professor Matthew Lew](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Matthew-Lew.html). 
    Before that, I was a master student in the 
    [Computational Imaging Group](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) with Prof. Ulugbek Kamilov.
    I worked on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Specifically, I proposed 
    the first neural field (NF) based video frame interpolation algorithm.
    <br><br>
    In 2019, I worked as a visiting research assistant at 
    [Center for Optoelectronic Technology, SIAT](http://coet.siat.ac.cn/mobile/web/page/show/136.shtml?type=100&category_id=0). 
    SIAT is a cool place where engineers and researchers made many brilliant products. 
    I focus on the design and building of in-situ chemical oxygen demand (COD) sensor 
    for long-term seawater monitoring. SIAT is where arouse my interest of optical systems. 
    Prior to that, I did my BS in NCU with Prof. Qiurong Yan. We built a single photon 
    compressed imaging system with digital micromirror device (DMD) and photomultiplier
    tube (PMT). It is a cool system that let me know how diverse the optical imaging system
    could be. 
    <br><br>
    I love imaging and computer vision (CV). I believe it is important to  
    collaboratively develop imaging systems and CV algorithms. This is where
    a lot of high quality innovations were crteated. 
    My current research interests include computational imaging, inverse problems, 
    Machine learning, Implicit neural representations, neural video representations, 
    video processing, video interpolation, computer vision, and so on.
    <br><br>
    Besides that, I enjoy playing a violin, hiking, taking photoes, and making videos. 
    Those hobbies make me calm down or inspire me when I was trapped down. 
    My favourate masterpiece is TCHAIKOVSKY's Violin Concerto in D major, op. 35.
